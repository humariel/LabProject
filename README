### How to Run Application ###

1. Make sure kafka is up and running:
	On your kafka installation directory:
		--> $ bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties
		--> $ bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties 

	Note:The ports used are the kafka default ones

2. Once kafka is running, run the server:
	First, go to the server folder of the project : LabProject/server .
	To run the server:
		--> $ mvn spring-boot:run
		--> Or use your IDE to run it

	Note: You may need admin privileges;
	      The server runs on port 8080;

3. Run the client:
	First, go to the client folder of the project : LabProject/client .
	To run the client:
		--> $ mvn spring-boot:run
		--> Or use your IDE to run it

	Note: The server runs on port 8081;

4. To see the application go to localhost:8081 on your browser.

### The REST API ###

After having the server running (steps 1 and 2 above) you can access the REST API 
at localhost:8080/api . The existing endpoints are /flights and /history .
